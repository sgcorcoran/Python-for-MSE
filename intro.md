# Welcome to MSE 2114 Math Programming for Materials Science and Engineering I

This is a 1 credit course introduction to the Python programming language.  This is a work in progress.  Currently, I only have a few of lessons for MSE 2114 uploaded.  I'll be adding more as we go along this semester.  

This book is live and as I make edits they will automatically show up here. This means you may see author notes in the book to remind me to add content for future versions.  Since this is an html version of the book, I think this will give you easier access to the content during the course and for future use.  I'd appreciate any comments for ideas to make things easier for you to learn or on material that is confusing and needs more explanation.
