# Welcome to MSE 3114 Math Programming for Materials Science and Engineering II

This is a 1 credit course follow on to MSE 2114.  This is a work in progress.  Currently I only have a few of your lessons from MSE 2114 included for your reference but I'll be adding more as we go along.  

This book is live and as I make edits they will automatically show up here.  This means you may see author notes in the book to remind me to add content for future versions.  Since this is an html version of the book, I think this will give you easier access to the content during the course and for future use.  I'd appreciate any comments for ideas to make things easier for you to learn or on material that is confusing and needs more explanation.
