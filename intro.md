# Welcome to Math Programming for Materials Science and Engineering

This is a series of two 1 credit courses in Python programming motivated by applications in Materials Science and Engineering.   

This book is live and as I make edits they will automatically show up here. This means you may see author notes in the book to remind me to add content for future versions.  Since this is an html version of the book, I think this will give you easier access to the content during the course and for future use.  I'd appreciate any comments for ideas to make things easier for you to learn or on material that is confusing and needs more explanation.
