# Welcome back!  I hope you had some time to play around with Python over the summer.  If not, you will probably feel like you are starting all over again.  If that is the case, please take a look at  [Getting Started with Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-quick-start) for a refresher.  A list of recommended LinkedIn Learning videos can also be found in the [Appendix](LinkedIn-Learning-Rec).  Your cheat sheet notebooks should also help you. Hopefully you still have one from MSE 2114 (the prerequisite to this course).
